I've been a frontend web software developer for a little shy of 20 years. During this journey, I have been privvy to see many different approaches to software product management, from advertising agency client work to physical product companies whom are also producing software as either an integral part of their product, or as a value-add for their products. In this article I intend to talk about these different experiences and interject with my thoughts on what worked and what didn't work.

## First, what is product management?

Product managers drive the development of products (software OR physical) to be built in as something that users love to use.

### Physical Products

Physical product domains might include consumer devices such as electronics (think...mobile phone or wireless headphones, for instance), healthcare devices and equipment (think...blood glucose monitor, MRI machine or blood pressure cuff), automobiles (think... Tesla Electric Vehicles or a Harley Davidson Motorcycle), fitness equipment (think...Carbon Fiber Road Bike or a Treadmill). The list of physical products is pretty much limitless, just look around the room you're in and I can guarantee you'll see dozens of physical products that were developed with the help of a product manager.

### Software Products

Software products are my domain. Having been a software developer for the better part of twenty years, I have been involved with the product management and development of dozens of software products ranging from advertising agency client web sites, to online banking and wealth management software for a major financial institution, as well as fortune 100 pharmaceutical sofware designed to improve health outcomes for patients and help doctors more effectively treat and interact with their patients. All of these software products have specific roles and goals in the lives of their users.
