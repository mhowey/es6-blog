## GraphQL Journal

What does that mean? GraphQL Journal? Well, it basically means that I'm going to write a journal about my journey with GraphQL. I'm going to walk you through how _I_ learned it and the steps I took to help convert an existing microservice REST API to a flexible and effective GraphQL-based data-retrieval system. I haven't donee it yet, so in advance, I ask for you forgiveness in my naivety while I figure this out! Hopefully, by documenting my journey, I may help someone in the future who may decide to really utilize GraphQL to iprove the software product that they work on!

## Why GraphQL?

I really geek out about ReactJS lately. It _IS_ the best thing since sliced bread. There are create-react-app, GatsbyJS, Next.js, and there also is ?? GraphQL?? I know, it's not a react-specific technology like the other three. So you might ask, what even made you think about GraphQL? ...and this is a very isightful question! Thanks Kyle Matthews and the GatsbyJS community for introducing me to GraphQL! It was your use of GraphQL that made me realize I needed to learn GraphQL, and for more than just making simple queries to build a static blog with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org" target="_blank">Gatsby</a>. Check-out Gatsby, I think you'll like what you find!

Assuming you are familiar with the standard REST API convention, and some of its shortfalls with more complicated "multi-node" data sources, I think you might quickly see the advantages of implementing a GraphQL data-fetching scheme. I'm going to find out and bring you along. We'll be looking at converting a legacy extjs system over to React while also making a microservice REST API syte over to a GraphQL system. It's huge undertaking that will be executed in an Agile-Scrum way!

## Scrum? But this is about the Queries!

Wait, why am I bringing project management methodologies into this discussion about code? Because it is part of how this effort will get to a "done" state. Meaning the entire system is converted over to ReactJS and GraphQL and is operating reliably. Considering my previous experiences, I feel as though the only way this will be accomplished effectively is by utilizing the Scrum framework. Therefore, I will also be writing about the experience from the perspective of an agile proponent and scrum master.

## So What Have I Done So Far?

Not much but write a bunch of bullshit in this blog. I haven't even started my new job, but I actually have. I'm already starting on the GraphQL journey, and it's exciting as hell! I've take a couple Udemy courses taught by Stephen Grider and I have to admit, this was a true catalyst for me. There are stars like Nicholas Zakas whom influenced me with his talk "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5pFv9NB9fs" target="_blank">Scalable JavaScript Application Architecture</a>" I mean this talk is absolutely incredible. Very little code, but lots of theory. It can be applied to pretty much any front-end architecure. It sounds a lot like React, Angular, Vue, etc. 

Whether you are using an ultra-modern framework or library like React, Vue, or Angular or a more relaxed DOM-manipulation library like jQuery.
