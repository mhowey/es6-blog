Wait? What is this? A new framework?? Yep, a new framework. Don't get me wrong, I'm all-in on React's rich ecosystem that encompasses the worlds of create-react-app, gatsby, NEXT, GraphQL (not really a React-specific technology), Redux (again, not a React-specific technology) and all of the other software development goodness that surrounds these things! However, I've heard rumblings of an interesting new framework called "Svelte3". Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski checked it out on a recent episode of the Syntax.FM podcast, and they seemed pretty impressed. Some of what they were saying seemed really interesting, so I figured why not check it out for myself?

## Initial Impression

So, as most software developers know, the initial experience with a new library or framework can be made or broken based on the intro documentation. Svelte3 has a nice interactive tutorial (read: "codepen style playgrounds"...) to get you started on the basics of how Svelte works. This was perfect as it allowed me to explore not only the tutorial step I was looking at, but anything I felt like trying. Break all the things!

## So What is Different About Svelte?

Svelte3 does a lot of the stuff we wish other frameworks would do without jumping through all the hoops, or at least that's my impression having run through a few pages of the tutorial. Everything seems more like plain CSS, plain old Javascript, and plain old HTML -- but Svelte3 is providing some magic for us that makes this stuff work the way we wish it worked out of the box.

## Comparing React and Svelte Components

Here's a basic "Hello World" component in React:

_HelloWorld.js (React):_

```javascript
const HelloWorld = () {
  return <div>Hello World!</div>
}

export default HelloWorld;
```

If you're a React developer, you probably think that is one of the most simple components you'll ever see, right?

**Check it out in Svelte3...**

_HelloWorld.svelte (Svelte3):_

```javascript
<div>Hello World!</div>
```

**Huh? That's not a component?!?!** Isn't that just HTML? That's what it looks like, but since Svelte3 is compiled to Javascript, it actually looks something like this... (There isn't really a need to try and read/understand the following snippet as it's the compiled JS output from the Svelte compiler)...

```javascript
/* App.svelte generated by Svelte v3.9.2 */
import {
  SvelteComponent,
  detach,
  element,
  init,
  insert,
  noop,
  safe_not_equal,
} from 'svelte/internal'

function create_fragment(ctx) {
  var div

  return {
    c() {
      div = element('div')
      div.textContent = 'Hello World'
    },

    m(target, anchor) {
      insert(target, div, anchor)
    },

    p: noop,
    i: noop,
    o: noop,

    d(detaching) {
      if (detaching) {
        detach(div)
      }
    },
  }
}

class App extends SvelteComponent {
  constructor(options) {
    super()
    init(this, options, null, create_fragment, safe_not_equal, [])
  }
}

export default App
```

Aha! That's where it all happens!! A really cool thing about the Svelte interactive playground is that it shows you what your code is compiled to. That's where the javascript block above came from. Kinda cool stuff.

## What About Styling?

In React land, all the cool kids are using some sort of CSS-in-JS solution like Styled-Components or JSS and usually, the purpose is to help encapsulate the CSS into classes that won't collide and/or overwrite each other in the DOM. This basic concept doesn't come with React out of the box, so these third-party solutions are necessary.

Svelte3 has a styling system that automatically scopes your CSS to the HTML that is part of that component to prevent CSS leakage to other parts of your application. CSS's cascading and encapsulation concepts can be kind of hard to understand for all but the most astute CSS users.

**An example to show how CSS is handled in Svelte3**

_extending our HelloWorld example with styling..._

```html
<h3>Hello World!</h3>
<style>
  h3 {
    color: rebeccapurple;
    font-size: 2em;
  }
</style>
```

Again, this looks just like an HTML document, doesn't it? When Svelte compiles this, we end up with a stylesheet that looks like this...

```css
h3.svelte-eh7q0i {
  color: rebeccapurple;
  font-size: 2em;
}
```

**I didn't specify a class of .svelte-eh7q0i**?!?!

Interesting! Our simple h3 style definition was transformed into a styled definition for a custom className that is unique to that component. So with this nice little tidbit of built-in awesome sauce we can safely write CSS (in standard notation, I might add!) in a Svelte component.

This doesn't answer the question of how it handles themes and global styles, but this along is really nice. We'll get into more details should I decide to continue exploring Svelte further in a later article. This is supposed to be "first-impressions" rather than a deep-dive comparison of Svelte to other frameworks. I digress...

## What About Javascript??

It's pretty much the same idea as the styling from the most basic standpoint. You simply use a `script` tag and write your Javascript inline in the component. You can use curly braces to execute and output variables and other javascript expressions. So again let's take our HelloWorld.svelte project...

```html
<script>
  const name = 'Robert'
</script>
<style>
  h3 {
    color: purple;
    font-size: 2em;
  }
</style>
<h3>Hello {name}!</h3>
```

Now, we have a component that has a custom javascript variable (i.e. 'name'), that also has some custom css styling that is automatically scoped to the component (via the custom class that gets applied during compilation). The h3 in this component will be purple and 2em in size, but other h3's outside this component will not.

## Composition

Just as in a React app, you can import components from other files and compose them together by nesting them inside of each other, Svelte uses the same pattern. One of the major differences is that the component name is defined by the file name in Svelte, as opposed to being specified like you might with React.
