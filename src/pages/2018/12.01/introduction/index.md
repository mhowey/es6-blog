Thanks to the Rolling Stones for the title of my intro post, and thanks to Kyle Matthews
and GatsbyJS for a kick-ass platform to build this blog on!

## What's this blog about?

Web development, general technology and gadgetry, bicycling, and just about
anything that I decide I want to write about. Hopefully any of you who have come across
this thing will find some of it interesting and/or useful. If you want me to write
about something specific, please let me know and I'll do my best to ablige.

## GatsbyJS+React+Markdown+Netlify = Bliss

This site is built with GatsbyJS. Again, a big thanks goes out to Kyle Matthews for creating
a world-class code-base to build upon. This site feels fast and is fast because of his
hard work on top of the excellent work of the ReactJS team over at facebook.

If you're not familiar with ReactJS or Gatsby, I highly recommend checking them both out.
Of course, I could have just started this thing with a regular old 'create-react-app', but
why? I wanted to be able to deploy this blog to Netlify as a static website, and well,
Gatsby already has this tooling ready and it's only getting better by the day.

Now, I can just write a new post, push it to the Master branch and voila, published!
Right now, the text you are reading originates in a Markdown file and is "sucked in" to
Gatsby using Graphql queries.
